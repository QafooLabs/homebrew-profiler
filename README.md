# Homebrew Formulas for Tideways Profiler

With this repository you can install the Tideways Profiler Daemon, Commandline-Tool and PHP Extension via Homebrew.

Requirements: [homebrew-php](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-php)

1. Tap this repository

	    brew tap tideways/homebrew-profiler

2. a.) Install PHP Extension (if you have `homebrew-php`)

	    brew install php54-tideways
	    brew install php55-tideways
	    brew install php56-tideways
	    brew install php70-tideways
	    brew install php71-tideways
	    brew install php72-tideways

    If you get an error about a missing "php.h", then try again with the flag --env=std

	    brew install php71-tideways --env=std

    **Notice: The installer uses PHPs "auto_prepend_file" to load the Tideways.php library.
    This is different from how the Linux version of Tideways works. Make sure that
    the `/usr/local/etc/php/7.1/conf.d/ext-tideways.ini` contains the `auto_prepend_file`
    directive.

2. b.) Install PHP using System PHP

        brew install php54-tideways --without-homebrew-php

3. Install Daemon

	    brew install tideways-daemon

4. Install Commandline Tool

	    brew install tideways-cli
